## 1. Introduction

TeachMe was created with the goal of making education accessible and affordable for everyone. We understand that not all students learn at the same pace or in the same way, and that's why we've developed a platform where students can connect with professors who can provide personalized one-on-one instruction.

Our app makes it easy for students to find the right professor for their needs. With TeachMe, you can search for professors by subject, location, availability, and price. Once you find a professor you're interested in, you can view their profile, read reviews from other students, and schedule a private class at a time that works for you.

TeachMe is not just for students who need extra help with a particular subject. We also cater to students who are looking to get ahead of their class, or who are interested in learning something new that may not be covered in their school's curriculum. Our platform is perfect for students of all ages, from primary school to university level.

## 6. Out of scope

- Group Classes: TeachMe focuses on providing personalized one-on-one instruction, so group classes would be out of scope for the project.

- Social Media Integration: Integrating social media features into TeachMe, such as the ability to share professor profiles or lesson materials, could help students build a community of learners and educators.

- Language Support: Expanding language support beyond Bosnian could help TeachMe reach a wider audience of students and professors around the world.

- Skill Assessments: Incorporating skill assessments into the app could help students identify their strengths and weaknesses in a given subject, as well as suggest appropriate professors to work with.
